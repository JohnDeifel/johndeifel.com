            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to my personal website! I'm a computer science student at Illinois Institute of Technology with passion for full-stack development and artificial intelligence. My life in the world of technology began with the excitement of video games/entertainment, and has evolved into solving complex problems by leveraging various technologies. As a student, I am constantly exploring and expanding my knowledge as much as possible. I love to learn new music on guitar, meet new people, and dive into new technologies.

                This website serves as a directory of my projects and achievements on technology and music. Feel free to explore my work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you share similar interests or exciting opportunities for collaboration.
